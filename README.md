During the IPL season , we all love to watch matches between our favourite teams and predict the score of the team would be scoring in an innings . Our project will assist you in predicting the score of first innings of an IPL match.
</br>
It use machine learning algorithm and based on data of previous played IPL match from year 2008-2021 from kaggle dataset to help in predicting score of `TATA IPL 2022` and using Flask we have developed a web app and deployed it using Heroku.
</br>
### Usage :
<p>
Instructions to use the website :
<ol>
<li> Select the `Bowling` and `Batting` Team </li>
<li> With minimun threashold value of 6.0 overs give number of over passed </li>
<li> Provide current run scored and number of wickets fallen</li>
<li> Provide run scored and number of wickets fallen in last 5 Overs (to track current performance </li>
<li> Predicting the final score of first inning with comparision of different machine learning models such as :
	<ul>
  		<li> `Linear Regression`
  		<li> `Ridge Regression`
  		<li> `Random Forest Regression`
  		<li> `Artificial Neural Network (Multi Layer Perceptron)`
	</ul> 
</li>
</ol>
